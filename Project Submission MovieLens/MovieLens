# Course/Capstone Project: All Learners/Project Submission: MovieLens

Your submission for this project is three files:

Your report in Rmd format
Your report in PDF format (knit from your Rmd file)
A script in R format that generates your predicted movie ratings and RMSE score (should contain all code and comments for your project)
You may upload the three files directly to the edX platform or submit a GitHub link in the text response box below.

To upload and submit your files press the "Choose Files" button, select three files at once (using the control key on a Windows machine or command key on a Mac) and press "Choose," type a description for each (PDF, Rmd, R), and then press the "Upload files" button. If uploading files, we recommend also providing a link to a GitHub repository containing the three files above in case there is a problem with the upload process.

Note that when downloading files for peer assessments, R and Rmd files will be downloaded as txt files by default.
