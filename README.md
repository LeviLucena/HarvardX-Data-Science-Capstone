# HarvardX PH125.9x Capstone Project: Movie Recommendation ðŸŽ“

# Course description
To become an expert data scientist you need practice and experience. By completing this capstone project you will get an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills in R data analysis that you have gained throughout the series. This final project will test your skills in data visualization, probability, inference and modeling, data wrangling, data organization, regression, and machine learning.

Unlike the rest of our Professional Certificate Program in Data Science, in this course, you will receive much less guidance from the instructors. When you complete the project you will have a data product to show off to potential employers or educational programs, a strong indicator of your expertise in the field of data science.

## Introduction

In the [Introduction](#1-introduction) section, the project's goals and objectives are outlined. It provides an overview of the MovieLens dataset and the motivation behind building a movie recommendation model. 

## Data Preprocessing

The [Data Preprocessing](#2-data-preprocessing) section covers the initial steps of data loading, cleaning, and transformation. It includes details on extracting genre and year counts from the movies dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation

In the [Model Training and Evaluation](#3-model-training-and-evaluation) section, the process of training a movie recommendation model is explained. It highlights the use of the randomForest algorithm and the evaluation of the model's performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Visualizations

The [Visualizations](#4-visualizations) section showcases various visualizations used to analyze movie ratings, genres, and the model's predictions. It includes histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts for a better understanding of the data.

## Interactive Datatable

The [Interactive Datatable](#5-interactive-datatable) section demonstrates the implementation of an interactive datatable using the DT package. This datatable allows users to explore the test data dynamically.

## Conclusion

The [Conclusion](#6-conclusion) section summarizes the project's achievements, insights gained, and model performance. It also suggests future steps for improving the model and expanding its capabilities.

## References

The [References](#7-references) section acknowledges the resources and references that contributed to the project's development.
