cat("We have completed our movie recommendation project using the MovieLens 10M dataset. Our model achieved an RMSE of ", rmse_text, ", indicating the accuracy of our predictions. Additionally, we generated recommendations for the user with ID 1.\n\n")
cat("In conclusion, this capstone project successfully explored the MovieLens dataset, analyzed movie ratings and genres, and developed a movie recommendation model. Throughout the project, we achieved the following:\n\n")
cat("- **Data Exploration:** We gained insights into the distribution of movie ratings, genres, and release years. This exploration helped us understand the characteristics of the dataset.\n")
cat("- **Model Development:** We trained a recommendation model using the randomForest algorithm. The model successfully predicted movie ratings based on available features.\n")
cat("- **Model Evaluation:** We evaluated the model's performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The achieved RMSE value of ", rmse_text, " reflects the accuracy of our predictions.\n")
cat("- **Visualizations:** We created visualizations, including a histogram of movie ratings and a scatter plot comparing predicted and actual ratings. These visualizations provided a clearer understanding of our model's performance.\n")
cat("- **Interactive Datatable:** We provided an interactive datatable to explore the test data, allowing users to delve deeper into the dataset.\n\n")

# 6.1 Future Steps
cat("6.1 Future Steps\n")
cat("While we have accomplished the main objectives of this project, there are opportunities for further improvements and exploration:\n\n")
cat("- **Feature Engineering:** We could explore additional features, such as user demographics or movie metadata, to enhance the model's performance.\n")
cat("- **Advanced Algorithms:** Exploring more sophisticated recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering or matrix factorization, could lead to even more accurate predictions.\n")
cat("- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters could potentially improve its performance.\n\n")
